      Split Times are the publicly viewable time data for Entrants at Splits along the Course. A typical ultramarathon
      might have thousands of Split Times in a single Event. OpenSplitTime checks Split Time data as it is entered,
      submitted, and imported, and uses statistical analysis to flag any times that appear bad or questionable.

      Split Times should not be confused with
      <%= link_to 'Raw Times', getting_started_path(topic: :terms, page: 8) %>, which are the original, often
      messy, behind-the-scenes log of all recorded times, whether correct or incorrect.
