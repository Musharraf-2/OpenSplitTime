    <p>Try to keep abreast of Problem efforts during the Event. Early discovery of problems may enable you to fix a
      procedure and avoid the problem being repeated over the course of the Event.</p>
    <p>If time does not permit during the Event, you can always fix problems after the Event concludes. Keep in mind,
      however, that <strong>problems affecting final standings will need to be understood before awards are
      presented</strong>.</p>
    <p>You can fix problems by editing times, deleting times, or confirming times. More details are provided in the
      <%= link_to 'Fixing Problems', docs_management_path(topic: :enter, page: 4) %> page.</p>
