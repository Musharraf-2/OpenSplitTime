      Raw Times are the permanent timing log created as an Event Group is taking place. As time data are captured by
      volunteers using <%= link_to 'OST Remote', ost_remote_path %> or manually entered using the Live Entry view, they are recorded first as Raw Times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raw Time data is captured in the form it comes in, warts and all. Human error is intentionally preserved to ensure
      a
      complete record. If a volunteer enters Bib 101 coming in to Pole Creek at 10:30, and later enters Bib 101 coming
      in
      again to Pole Creek at 10:45, both records will be preserved as Raw Times. Later analysis will be needed to
      determine whether the 10:30 entry or the 10:45 entry was correct. And the incorrect entry is still valuable, as it
      might match with another runner whose bib was misread by the volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>Raw Time data is not intended for public view; it is a behind-the-scenes record. Our best interpretation of the
      Raw Time record is presented to the public in the form
      of <%= link_to 'Split Times', getting_started_path(topic: :terms, page: 9) %>.</p>
