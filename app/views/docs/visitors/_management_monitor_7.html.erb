  <h4 class="card-header">Raw Times List</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>You can see all Raw Times for an entire Event Group by visiting the Raw Times List screen (<strong>Raw Times >
      List</strong>). By default, Raw Times are sorted by time created. The sort order can be changed by clicking any of
      the blue headings in the table.</p>
    <p>In most cases, the Raw Times List is more useful when filtered to show Raw Times related to only one or a few
      Efforts. You can filter Raw Times by typing a bib number (or multiple bib numbers separated by spaces or commas)
      into the search box and clicking the blue <strong>Search</strong> icon.</p>
    <p>Each Raw Time indicates its bib number, the related name and Event (if the bib is valid), the station where the
      Raw Time was recorded, the time information, whether or not the Entrant stopped at that point, and the source and
      creation time for the record. In addition, each Raw Time indicates if it has been <strong>pulled for
      review</strong> by a human, and if so, when and by whom. Finally, it indicates whether the Raw Time has been
      <strong>matched to a Split Time</strong>.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <p>As a shortcut, you can reach the Raw Times List from the Effort screen. Visit an Effort screen and then click the
      green <strong>Raw Time Records</strong> button. You will be taken to the Raw Times List screen with times already
      <strong>filtered for the Effort you were viewing</strong>.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <p>When a Raw Time is submitted by OST Remote, it is saved to the database and analyzed. If OpenSplitTime evaluates
      the Raw Time as <strong>good</strong> or <strong>questionable</strong>, it will be saved as a Split Time
      automatically without human review. When a Raw Time is automatically <strong>saved</strong> as a Split Time, it is
      also automatically <strong>matched</strong> with that Split Time.</p>
    <p>In a typical Event Group, most Raw Times will be automatically saved as Split Times. As a result, they will show
      as being <strong>matched</strong> but <strong>not pulled for review</strong>.</p>
    <p>When a Raw Time is submitted by OST Remote and OpenSplitTime evaluates the time as <strong>bad</strong>, the Raw
      Time is not automatically saved as a Split Time. These Raw Times will initially show as being <strong>not
      matched</strong> and also <strong>not pulled for review</strong>. When these Raw Times are pulled for review into
      the Live Entry screen, they will be marked as <strong>pulled for review</strong>. If these times are submitted
      without change, they will be marked as <strong>matched</strong>. If (as is more often the case) these times are
      modified in the Live Entry view before being submitted, they will be marked as <strong>not matched</strong>, and
      instead a new Raw Time record will be created for the modified time entry.</p>

  <h4 class="card-header">Un-Pulling and Deleting Raw Times</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>If a Raw Time has been pulled for review, the <strong>Pulled</strong> icon next to the Raw Time will be blue, and
      if it has not been pulled for review, the <strong>Pulled</strong> icon will be white.</p>
    <p>If a Raw Time has been pulled for review but for some reason you need to pull it for review again, you can click
      the blue Pulled icon. The icon will change to white, and the Raw Time will be available to pull once again.
      <strong>This is not common</strong>. It probably will be used only when a Raw Time was pulled for review and then
      inadvertently discarded from the Live Entry Local Data Workspace when it should have been modified and submitted.
    </p>
    <p>In unusual circumstances, you may want to delete a Raw Time entirely, removing it permanently from the record.
      <strong>Please do not delete any Raw Times unless there is a very good reason for doing so.</strong> We recommend
      that you keep a complete record of all Raw Times, whether or not valid, so that you have a good audit trail to
      determine how and when problems occurred.</p>
    <p>To delete a Raw Time, click the <strong>Delete (trash can)</strong> icon corresponding to the Raw Time.</p>
