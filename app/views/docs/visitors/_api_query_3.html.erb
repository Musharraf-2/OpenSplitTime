    <p>The OpenSplitTime API supports some additional queries that go beyond standard RESTful endpoints. In particular,
      you can query for an event with all of its efforts and related split times in this manner:</p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key" https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/events/5/spread</code>
    <hr/>
    <p>The response is not a standard JSON API response, but rather a more compact version that includes all
      time data for the event. Time data can be returned in three formats: elapsed, absolute, and segment. The format
      is determined by the <code>displayStyle</code> parameter. If no <code>displayStyle</code> parameter is passed,
      results will be returned with absolute times.</p>
    <p>For example, to obtain event time data with elapsed times, the request would look like this:</p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key"
      https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/events/5/spread?displayStyle=elapsed</code>
