  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Individual records are generally more useful and response times will be much faster. You can query for an
      individual record using its id.</p>
    <p>Most records in OpenSplitTime have both a numeric id (the unique database id) and a "slug" or "friendly" id,
      which is used in the URL for easy readability by humans. The OpenSplitTime API will respond to either the numeric
      id or the slug. For example, the following two queries (remember to use your own API Key in place of
      <code>your.api.key</code>):
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key" https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/events/5</code>
    <hr/>
    <p>or</p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key"
      https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/events/hardrock-100-2013</code>
    <hr/>
    <p>will return exactly the same result.</p>

    <p>Most record queries will return relationships that include the type and id of related records. You can include
      full data for these relationships using an <code>include</code> parameter in your query (remember to use your own
      API Key in place of <code>your.api.key</code>):</p>
