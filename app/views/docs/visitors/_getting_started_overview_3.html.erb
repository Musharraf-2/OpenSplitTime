  <div class="card-body">
    <p><strong><%= link_to 'Raw Time:', getting_started_path(topic: :terms, page: 8) %></strong> A single time at which
      a bib number is recorded live at a given Split while an Event is ongoing. Raw Times are viewable by Organization
      personnel and stewards, but <strong>not by the general public</strong>. Raw Times are recorded using the Live
      Entry screen in opensplittime.org or <%= link_to 'OST Remote', ost_remote_path %>, the easy-to-use iOS
      client app for live time recording.</p>
    <p><strong><%= link_to 'Split Time:', getting_started_path(topic: :terms, page: 9) %></strong> A
      <strong>publicly viewable</strong> time at which an Entrant is deemed to have been recorded at a given Split. When
      Raw Time records are available, as is the case when times are recorded live using OST Remote, Split Times will
      ideally represent the best possible interpretation of the complete Raw Time record.</p>
