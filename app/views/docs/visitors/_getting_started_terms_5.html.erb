      An Event is just that--a single event run on a single Course, with one or more Entrants participating in the
      event. If you have groups running different Courses (even if they are happening at the same time), you'll need to
      have an Event for each Course, and those Events would belong to a single Event Group.

      For example, <%= link_to 'Quad Rock 50 (2018)', event_path('quad-rock-50-2018') %> and
      <%= link_to 'Quad Rock 25 (2018)', event_path('quad-rock-25-2018') %> are two separate Events belonging to a single
      Event
      Group, <%= link_to 'Quad Rock 2018', event_group_path('quad-rock-2018') %>, even though both are run at the
      same time and even though the 25-mile Course covers the same territory as the 50-mile Course.
