  <h3>About OpenSplitTime: Our Mission</h3>
  <hr>

  <p>
    <strong>Endurance events change people.</strong> They create hard challenges in a soft world. They bring us together
    when
    our natural inclination might be to wander alone. They help us feel the simple joys of food, warmth, and rest by
    exposing us to cold, hunger, and discomfort. They help us realize how much more is buried within when we seem empty
    and dry.
  </p>
  <p>
    We love to compete, but many of us don't love to organize. And the tools for tracking and organizing endurance
    events
    have been sorely lacking. All that has now changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenSplitTime is a site for endurance athletes, fans and families, race directors, volunteers, support crews, and
    data geeks. Our
    purpose is simple: to make it easy to collect endurance event data, play with it, plan with it, safely archive it,
    and
    never worry about it again. If you are a race director, and particularly if you run a non-profit event, please
    upload
    your data. Instructions are <%= link_to 'here', docs_getting_started_path %>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your data will always be freely available to you and to your race participants. This site is supported exclusively
    by
    user donations. Sensitive data is carefully controlled and never released to unauthorized viewers. You can download
    or modify your data whenever you like. As a race director, you need fewer hassles. We hope this site makes
    your life a bit easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site is built and maintained by OpenSplitTime Company, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. If you find the website
    useful, motivating, entertaining, or strangely beautiful, please consider making a small
    <%= link_to 'donation', donations_path %> to help us keep the doors open. OpenSplitTime Company is registered
    with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Your donations are probably tax
    deductible (but if you have any question you should ask your tax advisor about that stuff).
  </p>
  <p>
    Our software engine is open source. If you have a suggestion for the site, or you are a software engineer and would
    like to help with development, or if you are a race director or data geek and would like to be a beta tester,
    please <%= mail_to 'mark@opensplittime.org', 'contact us' %> and let's talk.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenSplitTime is developed and maintained by endurance athletes for endurance athletes.
