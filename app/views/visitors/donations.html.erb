  <p>
    Your donations help us keep the lights on and the servers fed. We are a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, and 100% of
    your money
    goes to maintaining and improving the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are grateful for any and all donations, even if it's just a few dollars. You can use your credit card or a PayPal
    account.
    Our providers will send you a receipt for tax purposes, and you'll get a bit of extra good karma next time you get
    out on the trails.
